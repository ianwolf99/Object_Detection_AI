# Object Detection AI

Welcome to the Object Detection AI repository! This project contains scripts and resources for object detection using various AI models and computer vision techniques.

## Scripts
- **FLIP.py**: Python script to flip images horizontally and vertically.
- **Grayscale_images.py**: Python script to convert images to grayscale.
- **Rotate.py**: Python script to rotate images by a specified angle.
- **detect.py**: Python script for object detection using YOLOv5 model.

## Models
- **yolov5n.pt**: Pre-trained YOLOv5 model checkpoint.
- **yolov5s.pt**: Pre-trained YOLOv5 small model checkpoint.
- **yolov8n-seg.pt**: Pre-trained YOLOv8 segmentation model checkpoint.

## Images and Videos
- **bus.jpg**: Sample image of a bus.
- **car.jpg**: Sample image of a car.
- **video1.mp4**: Sample video file for testing object detection.

## Usage
To run the scripts, ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can use the following commands:
